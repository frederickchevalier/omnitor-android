omnitor-android
===============

Omnitor is an Android app that monitors the user's consumption of telco services in the background. The app records sent and received SMS, incoming and outgoing calls, bytes of data sent and received via mobile internet and WiFi/LAN, and the network roaming status. These logs are then uploaded to a server on a regular basis.

Omnitor is the open-source version of one of my past projects. The client recommends to the users the best mobile plan available from any local telco based on the collected data. The recommendation engine is no longer within the scope of this project.
