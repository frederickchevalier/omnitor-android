===============

Omnitor is an Android app that monitors the user's consumption of telco services in the background. The app records sent and received SMS, incoming and outgoing calls, bytes of data sent and received via mobile internet and WiFi/LAN, and the network roaming status. These logs are then uploaded to a server on a regular basis.
